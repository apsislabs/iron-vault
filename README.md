# Iron Vault

Iron Vault is a _toy_ password manager written in Rust. While the goal is to design
a secure system for managing passwords, it was not designed by a security expert and
has not been independently audited or evaluated by security experts.

As such it cannot be expressed strongly enough that Iron Vault is a _toy_ password manager. **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU PUT REAL PASSWORDS INTO IRON VAULT**.
